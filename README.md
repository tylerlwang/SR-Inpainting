A computer vision project based on the paper "Hierarchical Super-Resolution-Based Inpainting" (1)

USE WITHOUT ANY WARRENT

What the fuck have you done in your project?
???

How the fuck can I use the code:
Open Matlab and run "main"

What dependencies do I fucking need?

The code for loopy belief propagatin has highly referenced Nghia Ho's code in his article "Loopy belief propagation Markov Random Field stereo vision" (2).
